        <p>
          Welcome to the official portal of the <strong>Sales Optimization Project</strong> â€” a digital initiative
          focused on transforming how sales teams access, interpret and act upon sales data for strategic growth.
          This platform aims to optimize internal sales processes by reducing manual effort, enhancing KPI visibility
          and enabling faster, smarter and insight-driven decisions across teams.

      <div class="why-boxes">
        <div class="why-box">
          <h4>Efficiency</h4>
          <p>Automating repetitive sales tasks helps teams focus on strategic goals. By eliminating manual data
            retrieval and report generation, employees can spend more time analyzing insights and less time performing
            routine operations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-box">
          <h4>Accuracy</h4>
          <p>Leveraging centralized data tools ensures consistency across reports and dashboards. This reduces human
            error, provides a single source of truth, and builds confidence in sales figures presented to leadership and
            clients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-box">
          <h4>Scalability</h4>
          <p>As business grows, so does data complexity. A user-friendly and scalable solution enables seamless access
            to large datasets without performance bottlenecks â€” ensuring long-term viability and ease of expansion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-box">
          <h4>Decision-Making</h4>
          <p>Instead of relying on assumptions, data tools enable sales teams to identify trends, forecast outcomes, and
            proactively respond to market shifts â€” turning information into action and driving results.</p>

            <button class="collapsible-btn" onclick="toggleContent('dashboard')">Power BI Dashboard</button>
            <div class="content-box" id="dashboard">
              An interactable Power BI dashboard was developed for TMT, a steel long product, with the objective of
              enabling easier exploration and analysis of sales data. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly,
              with
              filters allowing users to dynamically adjust the view based on their specific needs. It displays sales
              value
              and features various graphs and visuals that help in sales analysis and identification of insights.
              <br><br>
              The initial version of the dashboard was created using data from a single state and a shorter time range,
              serving as a prototype to test the data structure, filtering functionality and visualization layout. This
              phase allowed for iterative refinements and validation of the dashboardâ€™s logic. Once the functionality
              and
              presentation were confirmed to be effective, the dashboard was scaled up to include all states and a
              complete time period, offering a comprehensive and organization-wide view of TMT sales performance.

          <div class="collapsible-section">
            <button class="collapsible-btn" onclick="toggleContent('prediction')">Machine Learning Prediction</button>
            <div class="content-box" id="prediction">
              This was developed in Python using Visual Studio Code and focused on building a machine learning-based
              forecasting model using the TMT sales data. The model was designed to address two key use cases: firstly,
              to
              predict sales for the next 12 months and secondly, to perform target-based prediction, where the user can
              either input a desired sales target to estimate when it will be achieved, or allow the model to suggest a
              target based on historical trends.
              <br><br>
              To implement this, the Prophet model developed by Meta Open Source formerly Facebook, was used for time
              series forecasting. It is well-suited for handling data with strong seasonality and irregularities such as
              missing values or outliers. The modelâ€™s outputs were visualized using Pythonâ€™s visualization libraries,
              making the predictions easy to interpret and valuable for planning and decision-making.

          <div class="collapsible-section">
            <button class="collapsible-btn" onclick="toggleContent('chatbot')">Sales Data Chatbot</button>
            <div class="content-box" id="chatbot">
              The chatbot was developed using HTML to solve a key challenge faced by internal users i.e. retrieving
              specific sales information quickly from a large Excel dataset. Manually searching through thousands of
              rows
              to locate sales figures for a particular customer, region, or time period was both time-consuming and
              prone
              to errors. The chatbot provides a streamlined solution by offering fast, accurate access to frequently
              required sales insights. A total of 27 predefined queries were implemented, based on real-world use cases
              identified during discussions with the Sales and IT Digital Solutions team. <br><br>
              These include queries such as top or bottom customers by sales, sales in a specific state or city,
              customer-wise quantity sold in a particular month and comparative analysis between periods or regions. To
              ensure ease of use, the chatbot interface was designed with clickable option for each query, rather than
              requiring users to type text inputs. This reduces the risk of input errors and simplifies the interaction
              for users. On selecting a query, the chatbot processes the request and returns an accurate response
              derived
              directly from the dataset. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual filtering and improves
              the speed and efficiency of internal reporting tasks. </div>
